Double-click `hinata_client.exe` to open HINATA Client.

## Configure Game

1. Follow the prompt to drag and drop or manually select the folder. This folder must contain `segatools.ini`.

   Typically: The `bin` folder for CHUNITHM, and the `Package` or `AMDaemon` folder for maimai.

2. Follow the prompt to select the working mode. Selecting a mode will display its pros and cons, along with [Optional Advanced Settings](advanced.md).
   
   If you have no special requirements, please choose `AimeIO mode` to ensure connection stability.
   
   When using `AimeIO mode`, if you are not using `fufubot_segatools`, please check `Deploy supported segatools`. Otherwise, you will not be able to scan Banapass-compatible cards starting with card number `3`, including `Legacy Banapass` and `Hikari IC`.
